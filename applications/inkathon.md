## Project Overview :page_facing_up:
### Overview

"Ink!athon is a full-stack boilerplate for ink! dapp development"

Ink!athon is the leading full-stack boilerplate for building production-grade dapps with ink! smart contracts and helps to drastically shorten the time developers need to get started with developing a fullstack application with ink!. The boilerplate comes in a monorepo setup for an efficient development experience and includes a state-of-the-art tech stack for frontend, backend, and smart contracts. It is enriched with a typesafe react hooks library (useInkathon), multiple basic pre-styled frontend components and different custom shorthand scripts to speed up the development as much as possible.

The first version of ink!athon was released in 2023 as an answer to the lack of tooling and the high entry barrier for developers into the ink! ecosystem. It significantly supported the ink! adoption being just a few months old and a completely novel ecosystem for smart contract and protocol development. Since then, ink!athon has become the leading boilerplate for ink! dapps in the Substrate ecosystem and is used by different teams and projects with mainnet deplyoments in production such as the official name service on Aleph Zero (AZERO.ID)[https://azero.id] or the leading liqudid staking solution (ike.xyz)[https://ike.xyz].

This application aims to support the development of Ink!athon v2 which will be a complete rewrite and upgrade of the existing boilerplate in order to modernize the codebase and bring it up to date with the latest version of ink! 6.0 and the Polkadot ecosystem with its transition from Wasm and pallet-contracts to the PolkaVM with RISC-V and pallet-revive. This is crucial as the switch to ink!v6 does not entail backwards compability with Wasm and ink! v5.

Ink!athon v2 targets the infrastructure category within inkubator providing crucial tooling to enhance the developer experience in the ink! ecosystem and remain the go-to solution for bootstrapping ink! dapps.


### Ink! Ecosystem Impact

Ink!athon and it's underlying react-hooks library useInkathon have developed to one of the leading and most used developer toolings in the ink! ecosystem. Several usage & adoption metrices underline its success and importance:
- 275 Github stars
- 800+ commits
- 65+ forks
- 25k+ useInkathon downloads (total)
- 250+ depending repositories and projects (e.g. Kusamarian - thekus.xyz, lastic, azero.id, ike.xyz, abax.finance, 1delta, soroswap, Regionx CoretimeHub, etc.)

As a go-to-resource for developers building dApps on Polkadot, Inkathon offers not only a great start into any project and developer journey but also has itself proven as a reliable and robust building block for more complex production-grade dApps handling business use-cases in defi and more. Moreover, due to its ability to kickstart any ink! related product, it has become a key pillar for any ink! related hackathon and event aiming to onboard new developers and projects into the ink! ecosystem.

Ink!athon Revive will ensure that ink!athon can continue devlivering value to the ink! developer community and further enhance and strengthen its positioning as the go-to-solution for dapps running on PolkaVM with pallets-revive.

### Project Details

Ink!athon Revive consists of a complete update and futureproofing of the boilerplate as well as the useinkathon react hooks library. Furthermore, we make ink!athon fully compatible with ink!6.0 and the future of pallet-revive and the PolkaVM.

Updating the ink!athon boilerplate stack contains the following items and libraries:
  
- Update to ink! v6 & pallet-revive
- Update to Next v15
- Update to TailwindCSS & shadcn/ui v4
- Add Network Definitions & Extend deployments.ts
- Due Updates (i.e. polkadot.js) & Security Fixes
- Switch to Bun
- Switch to Biome.js

Updating the useInkathon react hooks library contains the following items and libraries:

- Add Connection Button Example
- Add the ability to add custom SubstrateChain objects
- Due Updates (i.e. polkadot.js) & Security Fixes
- Switch to Bun
- Switch to Biome.js

With these upgrades, ink!athon will provide all state-of-the-art frontend libraries and packages that enable production-grade dapp development without any friction. Ink! significantly relies on the quality of full-stack dapps built on top.

In addition to upgrading the boilerplate and react hooks library, the following improvements and additions are planned in order to make inkathon as a whole even more robust, useful and powerful:

- **Updating ink!athon to support Dedot:** Over the last year, Dedot has become a valuable JavaScript client for Substrate and a viable alternative to polkadot.js. It has improved the developer experience on Polkadot and is thus a great value-add for the overall ink!athon stack. This integration gives ink!athon users the option to choose between two different proven clients.
- **Creating an inkathon-app CLI:** This will allow users to create new ink!athon projects with a single command fruther improving the developer experience and speed.
- **Documentation:** Currently Ink!athon only has a basic README.md & generated Typedocs as an documentation. We will develop a new standalone documentation that is easily accessible and conprehensive for developers getting started with developing dapps with ink!.

Here is what our project Ink!athon v2 will not entail:

Furthermore, NO external audit is needed for this project.

Business Model. Ink!athon is a fully open-source community-driven project and a public good for the Polkadot developer ecosystem. As such, there is no commercial interest nor business model for the project. So far, Ink!athon has been mostly self-funded and maintained by the Scio Labs team with additional support by the Aleph Zero Foundation.

### Team's experience

Please describe the team's relevant experience. If your project involves development work, we would appreciate it if you singled out a few interesting projects or contributions made by team members in the past.

The team of Scio Labs consists of experienced web3 developers with a rich background in development of ink!-focused products and tooling. One flagship project is the official on-chain domain name service AZERO.ID on the Aleph Zero Substrate chain, which has been one of the first production-grade dapps utilizing ink! smart contracts and running on top of inkathon and use!inkathon. Moreoever, the Scio Labs team has been one of the strongest proponents of ink! since 2022 and helped pushing its adoption in the wider Polkadot & Substrateecosystem by giving workshops, talks and helping curious developers across several hackathons. The team also started the "ink! developer group" on Telegram which over time, has become the leading ink developer community. The Scio Labs team already sucessfully worked for grants from Aleph Zero Foundation, Web3 Foundation, Ethereum Foundation and Aave among others.

## Development Status :open_book:

The current example frontend for ink!athon can be found [here](https://inkathon.xyz/) and the github repo [here](https://github.com/scio-labs/inkathon). The project has been started in September 2022 and has been improved and maintained ever since. In it's current state, ink!athon lacks certain updates and features to stay fully compatible with the latest and moreover, future expected updates of ink! and the Substrate ecosystem. As the go-to solution for frontend development of [ink! dapps](https://use.ink/frontend/overview#react) and its unique positioning and relevance among in-production projects, it is crucial to ensure that ink!athon always remains up to date and compatible with other building blocks in the ecosytem.

Prior to this application, we discussed the needed and required updates for ink!athon together with stakeholders such as the creators of ink! and its biggest supporters and maintainers like R0gue from Pop Network. Upgrading ink!athon to the most up-to-date stack, maintaining it and ensuring its ecosystem compatability is a priority issue for all ink! stakeholders.
